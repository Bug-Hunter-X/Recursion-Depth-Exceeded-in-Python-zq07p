This repository contains an example of a common Python error: Recursion depth exceeded. The `bug.py` file demonstrates a recursive function that lacks a proper base case. The `bugSolution.py` file offers a corrected version.  The error typically occurs when a recursive function calls itself too many times, exceeding the maximum recursion depth allowed by Python. This causes a `RecursionError`. The solution is to ensure that the recursive function always has a base case that will stop the recursion.
